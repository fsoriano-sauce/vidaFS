# WeScope Client Browser Setup - Team Guide

## 🚀 One-Time Setup (New Team Members)

1.  **Unzip** the folder you received.
2.  **Right-click** on `SETUP_TEAM.bat` and select **Run as Administrator**.
3.  **When prompted**, type **`Y`** to enable automatic background updates.
4.  **Done!** Your shortcuts are installed in `Desktop\Client Systems Shortcuts` and will now update themselves automatically every 15 minutes.

## 🔄 How it Works

- **No Manual Downloads**: You don't need to manage zip files manually.
- **Auto-Updates**: A hidden task checks for new client systems every 15 minutes.
- **Safe**: Your saved passwords and work profiles are never touched.
- **Silent**: Updates happen in the background without popups.

## 🩹 Troubleshooting

### Chrome shows "Managed by your organization"
1. This setup script automatically fixes this.
2. If it persists, close all Chrome windows and run `SETUP_TEAM.bat` again.

### Emergency: Security Wipe (Remove everything)
If you need to completely remove all WeScope data (profiles, passwords, and shortcuts):
1. Please ask your administrator (Frank) for the cleanup tool.
